                  The Disaster Financial Assistance (DFA) Program operates under provincial legislation: <i>Emergency Program Act</i> and the <i>Compensation and
                  Disaster Financial Assistance Regulation</i>. Ministry of Emergency Management and Climate Readiness BC is obliged to provide DFA in accordance with this legislation. Section 8(1) of the Regulation
                  states: “'eligible costs' does not include costs of expenses (a) recoverable at law of for which insurance was reasonably and readily available.”<br/><br/>
                  <b>A DFA applicant who could reasonably and readily have purchased overland flood, water damage or water seepage insurance is NOT eligible to receive DFA.</b><br/><br/>
                  “Readily available” means that a person could obtain this insurance from a local agent or broker. Also, we should not confuse reasonably available with affordable.
                  What a person can afford is subjective and specific to that person. What is important is that the price of the insurance was reasonable considering the risk.<br/><br/>
