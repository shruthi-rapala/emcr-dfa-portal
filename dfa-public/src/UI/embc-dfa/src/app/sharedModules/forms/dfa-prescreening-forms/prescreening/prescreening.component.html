                  <br/>You may be eligible for DFA and may submit an application. During the application process you will be required to declare that you carry no insurance (no fire, theft or liability) on
                  the property listed on this Disaster Financial Assistance application. If you are later to have found to have insurance you will  be required to repay any financial assistance you've
                  received.<br/><br/>
                  The Disaster Financial Assistance (DFA) Program operates under provincial legislation: <i>Emergency Program Act</i> and the <i>Compensation and Disaster Financial Assistance Regulation</i>.
                  Emergency Management BC is obliged to provide DFA in accordance with this legislation. Section 8(1) of the Regulation states: “'eligible costs' does not include costs of expenses (a)
                  recoverable at law of for which insurance was reasonably and readily available.”<br/><br/>
                  <b>A DFA applicant who could reasonably and readily have purchased overland flood, water damage or water seepage insurance is NOT eligible to receive DFA.</b><br/><br/>
                  “Readily available” means that a person could obtain this insurance from a local agent or broker. Also, we should not confuse reasonably available with affordable. What a person can
                  afford is subjective and specific to that person. What is important is that the price of the insurance was reasonable considering the risk.<br/><br/>
